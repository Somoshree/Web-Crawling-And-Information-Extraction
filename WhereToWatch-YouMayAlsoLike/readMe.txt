ROLL NUMBER: 20CS60R05
SUBJECT: CL-II ASSIGNMENT 9 (TASK 1)
COMMAND TO RUN THE PROGRAM: make
PLATFORM USED: WSL
PYTHON VERSION USED: python3

CODE FILES: task_main.py (CONTAINS THE CODE TO TAKE THE INPUTS AND DISPLAY THE OUTPUTS TO THE USER. ALSO CALLS THE SECOND CODE FILE FOR PARSING THE INPUT)
task_grammar.py (CONTAINS THE GRAMMAR AND THE TOKENS FOR PARSING AN HTML FILE)

ASSUMPTIONS AND FLOW OF PROGRAM:

1. THE GENRE NAME TO BE ENTERED BY THE USER MUST EXACTLY MATCH THE GENRE NAME THAT GETS DISPLAYED ON THE CONSOLE.

2. THE MOVIE NAME TO BE ENTERED BY THE USER MUST MATCH THE MOVIE NAME THAT IS SHOWN ON THE LIST OF MOVIES DISPLAYED IN THE CONSOLE (DON'T CONSIDER THE NUMBER IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE NAME INTO THE MOVIE NAME). ALSO ENTER THE YEAR OF THE MOVIE WHILE GIVING THE MOVIE NAME AS INPUT. ALSO THE MOVIE NAME THAT THE USER ENTERS IS CASE-INSENSITIVE, I.E. ENTERING THE SAME MOVIE NAME IN LOWER CASE OR UPPER CASE OR CAMEL CASE DOESN'T GIVE AN ERRORS AS LONG AS THE NAME MATCHES WITH THE ONE THAT IS DISPLAYED ON CONSOLE

3. ENTER 'E' (WITHOUT INVERTED COMMAS) TO EXIT OUT OF THE PROGRAM.

4. INITIAL CRAWLING TAKES TIME AS IT SAVES THE WEBPAGES OF ALL THE 10 GENRES. THEREAFTER, CRAWLING DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY TIME AS IT USES THESE SAVED WEBPAGES TO ANSWER THE QUERIES OF THE USER.

5. AFTER CRAWLING ALL THE WEBPAGES, A MENU CONSISTING OF THE 10 GENRES ARE DISPLAYED TO THE USER. ONCE THE USER ENTERS ONE OF THE GENRE NAMES AS INPUT, ALL THE 100 MOVIES CORRESPONDING TO THAT GENRE GETS DISPLAYED ONTO THE CONSOLE.

6. NOW THE USER IS PROMPTED TO ENTER A MOVIE NAME FROM THE LIST OF MOVIES THAT ARE DISPLAYED IN ORDER TO QUERY DETAILS ABOUT THE MOVIE NAME.  THE CORRESPONDING HTML FILE OF THE MOVIE IS PARSED.

7. NEXT, THE USER IS PROMPTED TO ENTER THE FIELD NAME THAT IT WISHES TO QUERY FROM THE LIST OF THE FIELD NAMES THAT ARE DISPLAYED ON THE CONSOLE. THE FIELD NAME ENTERED SHOULD MATCH IN A CASE-INSENSITIVE WAY WITH THE FIELD NAME THAT IS DISPLAYED ON CONSOLE, I.E. UPPER CASE OR LOWER CASE LETTERS DON'T MATTER. JUST THE NAME SHOULD BE IDENTICAL AS THE ONE THAT IS SHOWN ON SCREEN.

8. IN CASE OF THE FIELD 'YOU MAY ALSO LIKE', THE PROGRAM CODE GOES ON RECURSIVELY PARSING NEWER MOVIES AS IS ENTERED BY THE USER. WE CAN'T RETURN TO THE MENU SCREEN OF AN EARLIER MOVIE. WE CAN DIRECTLY EXIT FROM THIS RECURSIVE CALLING THROUGH ENTERING 'E' INTO THE CONSOLE.

9. FINALLY THE CORRESPONDING VALUE FOR THE FIELD NAME IS DISPLAYED ONTO THE CONSOLE. ALSO, A FILE NAMED AS 'result_log.txt' GETS FORMED IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE CODE FILES WHERE ALL THE LOGS OF THE QUERIES ARE STORED.
